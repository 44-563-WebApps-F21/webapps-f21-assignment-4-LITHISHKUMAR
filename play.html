    <p class="scene"> SCENE.--_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow
        tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind,
        opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets
        darker._

        _Present._--PRINCE PAUL MARALOFFSKI, PRINCE PETROVITCH, COUNT ROUVALOFF,
        BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.</p>


    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="speech petro">So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven
        at last, and is to take his seat here again.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul">Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my
        own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="speech petro">Naturally; you are always speaking.</p>


    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech petro"> No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.</p>

    <h4 class="name">COUNT R</h4>
    <p class="speech count">Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison,
        like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul">My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the
        world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed
        to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place.
        (_Enter the CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._)
        Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your
        Highness is looking a little pale to-day.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_slowly, after a pause_).</p>
    <p class="speech czare"> I want change of air.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_smiling_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul">A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial
        father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in
        Russia.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p>
    <p class="speech czare"> My Imperial father had kept me for six months in
        this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see
        some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery,
        though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand
        that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="speech czare">Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you,
        whatever you may know of a bad life.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul"> Experience, the name men give
        to their mistakes. I never commit any.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p>
    <p class="speech czare">No; crimes are more in your line.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_to the CZAREVITCH_).</p>
    <p class="speech petro">The Emperor was a good dealagitated about your late appearance at the ball last night,
        Prince.</p>

    <h4 class="name">COUNT R.</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_laughing_).</p>
    <p class="speech count"> I believe he thought the Nihilists had brokeninto the palace and carried you off.</p>

    <h4 class="name">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p class="speech baron">If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul">And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled
        himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad
        is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good
        salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the
        same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one'svinegar.</p>

    <h4 class="name">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p class="speech baron">A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a
        son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul">I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron.
        But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only
        immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time
        enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is
        in me.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="speech czare"> You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] PRINCE PAUL the
        _cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of
        Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well;
        you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_bowing_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul">Que voulez vous? I manage your father's
        business.

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p>
    <p class="speech czare"> You mismanage my father's business, you mean! Evil
        genius of his life that you are! before you came there was some love
        left in him. It is you who have embittered his nature, poured into his
        ear the poison of treacherous counsel, made him hated by the whole
        people, made him what he is--a tyrant!</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">(_The courtiers look significantly at each other._)</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_calmly_).</p>
    <P class="speech paul"> I see your Highness does want change of air. But
        I have been an eldest son myself. (_Lights a cigarette._) I know what it
        is when a father won't die to please one.</P>

    <p class="stage-direction">(_The CZAREVITCH goes to the top of the stage, and leans against the window, looking
        out._)</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_to BARON RAFF_).</p>
    <p class="speech petro"> Foolish boy! [4]He will be sent into
        exile, or worse, if he is not careful.[4]</p>

    <h4 class="name">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p class="speech baron">Yes.[5] What a mistake it is to be sincere!</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <P class="speech petro">The only folly you have never committed, Baron.</P>

    <h4 class="name">BARON RAFF</h4>
    <p class="speech baron">One has only one head, you know, Prince.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> My dear Baron, your head is the last thing any one would wish to take from you.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_Pulls out snuffbox and offers it to PRINCE PETROVITCH._)</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="speech petro">Thanks, Prince! Thanks!</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> Very delicate, isn't it? I get it direct from Paris. But
        under this vulgar Republic everything has degenerated over there.
        "Cotelettes à l'impériale" vanished, of course, with the Bourbon, and
        omelettes went out with the Orleanists. La belle France is entirely
        ruined, Prince, through bad morals and worse cookery. </p>
    <p class="stage-direction"> (_Enter the MARQUIS DE POIVRARD._)</p>
    <p class="speech paul"> Ah! Marquis. I trust Madame la Marquise is well.</p>

    <h4 class="name">MARQUIS DE P.</h4>
    <p class="speech marquis"> You ought to know better than I do, PRINCE PAUL; you see
        more _of_ her.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_bowing_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul"> Perhaps I see more _in_ her, Marquis. Your wife
        is really a charming woman, so full of _esprit_, and so satirical too;
        she talks continually of you when we are together.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_looking at the clock_).</p>
    <p class="speech petro">His Majesty is a little late
        to-day, is he not?</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul">What has happened to you, my dear Petrovitch? you seem
        quite out of sorts. You haven't quarrelled with your cook, I hope? What
        a tragedy that would be for you; you would lose all your friends.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="speech petro">I fear I wouldn't be so fortunate as that. You forget I
        would still have my purse.[6] But you are wrong for once; my chef and I
        are on excellent[7] terms.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> Then your creditors or Mademoiselle Vera Sabouroff have
        been writing to you? I find both of them such excellent correspondents.
        But really you needn't be alarmed. I find the most violent proclamations
        from the Executive Committee, as they call it, left all over my house. I
        never read them; they are so badly spelt as a rule.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="speech petro">Wrong again, Prince; the Nihilists leave me alone for some
        reason or other.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_aside_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul"> Ah! true. I forgot. Indifference is the revenge
        the world takes on mediocrities.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PETRO</h4>
    <p class="speech petro"> I am bored with life,[8] Prince. Since the opera season
        ended I have been a perpetual martyr to ennui.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul">The maladie du siècle! You want a new excitement, Prince.
        Let me see--you have been married twice already; suppose you
        try--falling in love, for once.</p>

    <h4 class="name">BARON R</h4>
    <P class="speech baron">Prince, I have been thinking a good deal lately--</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_interrupting_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul">You surprise me very much, Baron.</p>

    <h4 class="name">BARON R</h4>
    <p class="speech baron"> cannot understand your nature.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_smiling_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul">If my nature had been made to suit your
        comprehension rather than my own requirements, I am afraid I would have
        made a very poor figure in the world.</p>

    <h4 class="name">COUNT R.</h4>
    <p class="speech count">There seems to be nothing in life about which you would not
        jest.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> Ah! my dear Count, life is much too important a thing ever
        to talk seriously about it.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_coming back from the window_).</p>
    <p class="speech czare">I don't think PRINCE PAUL'snature is such a mystery. He would stab his best friend for the
        sake of
        writing an epigram on his tombstone, or experiencing a new sensation.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> Parbleu! I would sooner lose my best friend than my worst
        enemy. To have friends, you know, one need only be good-natured; but
        when a man has no enemy left there must be something mean about him.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_bitterly_).</p>
    <p class="speech czare">If to have enemies is a measure of greatness, then
        you must be a Colossus, indeed, Prince.</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> Yes, I know I'm the most hated man in Russia, except your
        father, [9]except your father, of course,[9] Prince. He doesn't seem to
        like it much, by the way, but I do, I assure you. (_Bitterly._) I love
        to drive through the streets and see how the canaille scowl at me from
        every corner. It makes me feel I am a power in Russia; one man against a
        hundred millions! Besides, I have no ambition to be a popular hero, to
        be crowned with laurels one year and pelted with stones the next; I
        prefer dying peaceably in my own bed.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="speech czare">And after death?</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_shrugging his shoulders_).</p>
    <p class="speech paul"> Heaven is a despotism. I shall
        be at home there.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="speech czare">Do you never think of the people and their rights?</p>

    <h4 class="name">PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> The people and their rights bore me. I am sick of both. In
        these modern days to be vulgar, illiterate, common and vicious, seems to
        give a man a marvellous infinity of rights that his honest fathers never
        dreamed of. Believe me, Prince, in good democracy every man should be an
        aristocrat; but these people in Russia who seek to thrust us out are no
        better than the animals in one's preserves, and made to be shot at, most
        of them.</p>

    <h4 class="name">CZARE</h4>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_excitedly_). </p>
    <p class="speech czare"> If they are[10] common, illiterate, vulgar, no
        better than the beasts of the field, who made them so?</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">(_Enter COUNT R._)</p>

    <h4 class="name">COUNT R.</h4>
    <p class="speech count"> His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor!</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">(_PRINCE PAUL looks at the CZAREVITCH, and smiles._)</p>

    <h4 class="name"> PRINCE PAUL</h4>
    <p class="speech paul"> Yes, I know I'm the most hated man in Russia, except your
